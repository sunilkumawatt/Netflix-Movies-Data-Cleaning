# Netflix-Movies-Data-Cleaning
 I completed a Netflix data cleaning project in Jupyter Notebook using Python. The process included handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates with Pandas and NumPy. I used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize insights and prepared a report summarizing the cleaned dataset and key findings.
